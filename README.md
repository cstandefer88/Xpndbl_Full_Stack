#Technologies Used

React, Node.js, Express.js, mLab(MongoDB), CSS

I used React to create the majority of the front end.  

I used MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node) to create a back end, a database, and to save to and route to and from and

CSS was used for styling.

#Approach Taken

Before I began coding, I did the following: 1. Brainstorming and choosing a project idea, 2. User Stories, 3. Wireframes, 4. Mapped out Components, 5. Potential Bonus Features, 6. Decided what needed to happen and in what order
